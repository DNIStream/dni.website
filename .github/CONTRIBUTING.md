# Contributions

DNI accepts contributions from the community into all of its open-source repositories. Contributors are encouraged to follow the steps below, which apply to all new features and bugs.

#### Log an issue / find an existing issue
* Search the issue board for an entry relating to the bug or feature
  * If you do not find a related entry, create one
* Await approval / discussion from the project creators - you may well be working on something that's already in progress, or isn't a priority

#### Once Approved
* Branch and / or fork to **feature/&lt;feature-name&gt;**. Note that a **feature/** prefix is required in order for the CI process to run and detect your changes
* Do your work
* Small commits are better than large ones
* Ensure all your changes are covered with passing tests
* Push any changes to build and test your changes
* Create a Pull Request into **master**
* Add notes and await approval
